# Next to the Blackjack table, the Python Challenge Casino has a slot machine. You can get a result from the slot machine by calling `play_slot_machine()`. The number it returns is your winnings in dollars. Usually it returns 0.  But sometimes you'll get lucky and get a big payday. Try running it below:

# In[49]:


play_slot_machine()


# By the way, did we mention that each play costs $1? Don't worry, we'll send you the bill later.
# 
# On average, how much money can you expect to gain (or lose) every time you play the machine?  The casino keeps it a secret, but you can estimate the average value of each pull using a technique called the **Monte Carlo method**. To estimate the average outcome, we simulate the scenario many times, and return the average result.
# 
# Complete the following function to calculate the average value per play of the slot machine.

# In[55]:

    """Run the slot machine n_runs times and return the average net profit per run.
