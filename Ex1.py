# Notebooks are composed of blocks (called "cells") of text and code. Each of these is editable, though you'll mainly be editing the code cells to answer some questions.
# 
# To get started, try running the code cell below (by pressing the ‚ñ∫ button, or clicking on the cell and pressing ctrl+enter on your keyboard).

print("You've successfully run some Python code")
print("Congratulations!")


# # Setup for running exercise
# 
# 1. Download learntools-master by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aZx9Lk1nvSwqqxyPEYnaiHhbJ40FMkew/view?usp=sharing)
# 2. Extract the zip in the same folder you are running this notebook
# 3. Right Click the zip and select 7-zip --> Extract Here
# 4. Copy the "learntools" folder to C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Lib\site-packages (*tip: ProgramData folder is hidden)

# Try adding another line of code in the cell above and re-running it. 
# 
# Now let's get a little fancier:  Add a new code cell by clicking on an existing code cell, hitting the escape key, and then hitting the `a` or `b` key.  The `a` key will add a cell above the current cell, and `b` adds a cell below.
# 
# Great! Now you know how to use Notebooks.
# 
# Each hands-on exercise starts by setting up our feedback and code checking mechanism. Run the code cell below to do that. Then you'll be ready to move on to question 0.

# # 0.
# 
# *This is a silly question intended as an introduction to the format we use for hands-on exercises throughout this course.*
# 
# **What is your favorite color? **
# 
# To complete this question, create a variable called `color` in the cell below with an appropriate value. The function call `q0.check()` (which we've already provided in the cell below) will check your answer.

# In[ ]:


# create a variable called color with an appropriate value on the line below
# (Remember, strings in Python must be enclosed in 'single' or "double" quotes)

# *Write you answer here*

# Check your answer
q0.check()


# Didn't get the right answer? How do you not even know your own favorite color?!
# 
# Delete the `#` in the line below to make one of the lines run. You can choose between getting a hint or the full answer by choosing which line to remove the `#` from. 
# 
# Removing the `#` is called uncommenting, because it changes that line from a "comment" which Python doesn't run to code, which Python does run.

#q0.hint()
#q0.solution()


# The upcoming questions work the same way. The only thing that will change are the question numbers. For the next question, you'll call `q1.check()`, `q1.hint()`, `q1.solution()`, for question 2, you'll call `q2.check()`, and so on.

# | ``a / b``    | True division  | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``                            |
# | ``a // b``   | Floor division | Quotient of ``a`` and ``b``, removing fractional parts |
# | ``a % b``    | Modulus        | Integer remainder after division of ``a`` by ``b``     |
# | ``a ** b``   | Exponentiation | ``a`` raised to the power of ``b``                     |
# | ``-a``       | Negation       | The negative of ``a``                                  |
